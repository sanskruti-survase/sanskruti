# Working:
U1 (First NE555): Configured in astable mode to generate continuous square wave pulses.
U2 (Second NE555): Receives U1’s output and shapes/amplifies it to produce a stable vibrating pulse.
D1 (1N4007): Provides reverse polarity protection.
RC Network: Resistors and capacitors control timing frequency and signal debounce.
Use Case: Drives waveform generators or vibration motors in compact circuits.
